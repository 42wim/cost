// maybeAcceptBlock potentially accepts a block into the block chain and, if
// accepted, returns whether or not it is on the main chain.  It performs
// several validation checks which depend on its position within the block chain
// before adding it.  The block is expected to have already gone through
// ProcessBlock before calling this function with it.
//
// The flags modify the behavior of this function as follows:
//  - BFDryRun: The memory chain index will not be pruned and no accept
//    notification will be sent since the block is not being accepted.
//
// The flags are also passed to checkBlockContext and connectBestChain.  See
// their documentation for how the flags modify their behavior.
//
// This function MUST be called with the chain state lock held (for writes).
